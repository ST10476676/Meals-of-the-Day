WHAT’S A MEAL APPLICATION 
It is a meal planner or meal manager apps, is a software program which plans health meals for the day or days or organize them. (Amiri, and Hasan, 2023) 

Purpose of the App
The app is to provide users with a good variety of healthy food choices within the days of the user’s choice which can provide users with recipes to try-out when looking for different desirers. 

Design Considerations
Clean Layout, Using a clean and clear layout (font type and size) [ Schwen, 2020] to avoid clutters which can help users focus on the content with Simple Navigation which is the minimized scale which has less tabs, limited features to focus on the essentials and use of simple formation of the tabs which would be used.
When it comes to consistency visual identity and button styles will be considered where by a consistent visual identity throughout the app including colours [Nguyen, 2020], typography and imagery will be made significant to suit users upon the theme which might be for them and that button styles throughout the app to make it easier easy for users to recognize and interact with them.
Readability can be formatted by clear typographies where usage of clear and readable typographies which can be the font sizes, colours, and style with a sufficient contrast to be considered.
Error Messages which can be in a form of feedback where I would display clear and concise error messages to users, they encounter an error also with success message to users when they completed task, such as creating a meal plan.
Placement would be an addition of key features such as recipe discovery features on the home screen. [SAHARTANG and AZIZ, 2024]
